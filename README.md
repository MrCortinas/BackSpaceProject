This challenge was interesting, is about how to deal with massive amount of information,
in this case the best strategy is to divide and conquer to achieve the success.
After laying the fundation I began analyzing the information,
later on understanding the requirements I decided to separate values by their first character and create group base on them. 
After this, my intent was to separate even-further till I get a consider responce time  was good.
Next, in the initial test I got a total of 58 groups and the biggest group was around  21000, 
afterward testing my version 1, search method saw it was quite responce just by the first level of separation, 
so I try doing a version 2 just by  taking advantage of the array  filter option  for simplification.
Once that was tested several times I began looking into the test modules, after some test I decided to do some rework on some methods and classes just to improve  and clean up code.
Finally, now we have a very large amount of data that we can find and filter by way of easy,  responsive and efficient.
